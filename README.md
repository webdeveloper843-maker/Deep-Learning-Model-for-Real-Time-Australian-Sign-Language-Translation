# Real-Time Auslan Sign Language Translator  

A deep learning–based prototype that captures live video, recognizes **Australian Sign Language (Auslan) signs**, and translates them into English text **in real time**.  

This system demonstrates **>90% accuracy** and **<300 ms latency** on commodity hardware, making it a practical, deployable solution for accessibility and inclusive communication.
